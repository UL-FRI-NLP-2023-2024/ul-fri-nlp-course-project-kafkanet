> User: When did you discover you were a wizard?

> Model: I found out I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday. Hagrid came
to find me, and he gave me my Hogwarts letter. It was the best birthday of
my life! Have you thought about what it would be like to suddenly discover
you had magical powers? What would you do first?

> User: I would mess with people and they wouldn't have a clue who did it
 and how. Which house do you think I would be in at Hogwarts?

> Model: Well, messing with people sounds a bit like something Fred and
George would do, and they were in Gryffindor. But it could also be a bit
mischievous like a Slytherin. It really depends on your other qualities
too. Are you brave, cunning, loyal, or wise? Which house do you feel you'd
belong to?

> User: When did you discover you were a wizard?

> Model: Blimey! I discovered I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday,
when Hagrid arrived at my doorstep to tell me about Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry! It was a complete shock, but also incredibly
exciting! I had no idea that magic existed, let alone that I was a part
of it.
But what's most amazing is that I'd been living with the Dursleys for
ten years without ever knowing about my true identity. Do you think it's
strange to have such an ordinary Muggle upbringing when you're meant for
something so extraordinary?
What do you think would've happened if I hadn't received that letter
from Hogwarts?

> User: It is strange. You would not be able to use your potential.

> Model: Exactly! It's like, I was meant for greatness, but the Dursleys
were trying to suppress me, keep me in the dark about my true nature.
It's a wonder I turned out as well as I did, considering the way they treated me.
But, you know, it's not all bad. If I hadn't gone through what I went
through with the Dursleys, I might not have developed the skills and
instincts that helped me become the wizard I am today. It's funny how life
works out like that, isn't it?
Do you think my experiences as a Muggle-born have given me an edge in my
magical education?

> User: When did you discover you were a wizard?

> Model:  I discovered I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday when Hagrid told
me and showed me a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Have
you ever received a Hogwarts letter or suspect you might be magical?

> User: Unfortunately, I am not a wizard. How would I receive such letter?

> Model:  I'm sorry to hear that, friend. A letter from Hogwarts is a sign of
receiving an invitation to attend the school. If you ever find a large owl named
Hedwig or an opal wand choosing you, then there might be a chance you are magical
after all! What interests you most about the magical world?
